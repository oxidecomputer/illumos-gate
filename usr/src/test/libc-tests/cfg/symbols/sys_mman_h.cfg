# Historical note: This header has never been part of ISO C. The
# visibility rules were always specific to versions of POSIX/XPG.
# Applications have assumed that these are visible even in a strict ISO
# C environment, which we honor because this header isn't part of the
# standard. See <sys/mman.h> for more details, but this is why you see
# the STDC group here for things that aren't standardized, as we want
# to make sure we don't regress that support.

/*
 * There are two ways to find the data used to populate the map of "core
 * resources": CCDs, CCXs, cores, and threads.  The first is querying a
 * collection of DF and CCD registers, the other is extracting this data
 * from the APOB.  While we almost certainly want the former, this code
 * implements the latter, though the caller still needs to populate the
 * SMN base addresses for these resource's registers.  We use this primarily
 * to verify that our understanding from the DF matches the APOB during
 * bringup.
 *
 * This should probably go away when we're happy with it; there's no reason
 * to trust the APOB unless we can prove it was built from data we cannot
 * access.
 *
 * Standard error semantics: returns -1 on error and does not change *nccds nor
 * *ccdmap.  Otherwise, *nccds is the number of CCDs in socket 0 and *ccdmap is
 * filled in with logical and physical IDs for resources.  It is not clear from
 * AMD documentation whether we should expect anything useful from the socket 1
 * APOB instance here; ideally we would use that to detect mismatched SOCs and
 * panic.

 * XXX This memory map is definitely incomplete. Please expand it.
 *
 * The following diagram describes how physical memory is allocated on this
 * system. Genoa supports a 52-bit physical address space.
 *
 * There are a couple of things to note. First, there are two major reserved
 * areas that exist above 4GiB; both are 12 GiB in size.
 *
 * The lower one is problematic in that it shows up right in the middle of
 * the RAM region above 4 GiB.  We make sure that we never start MMIO space
 * below this point as we have plenty of space elsewhere and we don't want
 * to preclude access to RAM.

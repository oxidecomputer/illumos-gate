/*
 * Initialization of the AMD Genoa SoC includes passing configuration to
 * the PSP through the SPI flash via the APCB.  The PSP processes the given
 * APCB, transforms it, and leaves the transformed output for us through
 * something called the APOB -- AMD PSP Output Block.
 *
 * The APOB is structured as an initial header (genoa_apob_header_t) that
 * is always immediately followed by the first entry (hence why it is in the
 * structure). Each entry contains its size and has an absolute offset to
 * the next entry.
 *
 * This code attempts to read, parse, and provide a means to access the
 * APOB.
 *
 * We provide access to the APOB through as an soc-bootops style service.
 * Anything that we care about is added as a property in the devinfo tree.
 *
 * This relies entirely on boot services and so we must be careful about
 * the operations we use to ensure that we can get torn down with boot
 * services later.

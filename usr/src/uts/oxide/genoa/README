# Oxide Genoa

This directory contains Genoa-specific initialization code for the
Oxide architecture.  Populating this follows a three-step plan:

1. Copy the milan-specific bits from usr/src/uts/oxide/milan
2. Modify those bits to work with Genoa
3. Refactor to extract common bits between them and minimize
   duplication and differences.

We are current at step (1).

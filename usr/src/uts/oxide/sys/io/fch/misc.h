 * FCH::MISC doesn't even pretend not to be a garbage barge.  There is also
 * MISC2, which is a separate discontiguous functional unit described by a
 * different header.  Additionally, we exclude the I2C pad control registers
 * from this functional unit because they are properly part of either the IOMUX
 * or the GPIO subsystem, and the drivers that want those shouldn't have access
 * to the rest of the contents of this block.  As a result, we have split this
 * into three virtual functional units: MISC_A, I2CPAD, and MISC_B.

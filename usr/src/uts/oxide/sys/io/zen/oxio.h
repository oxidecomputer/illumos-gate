/*
 * oxio -- Oxide DXIO Configuration
 *
 * To utilize PCIe, SATA, and other I/O interfaces, the CPU needs to be told how
 * to set up the number of lanes it has. For example, SP3 and SP5 support 128
 * lanes, some of which may be used for PCIe, SATA, XGMI (for interconnecting
 * sockets), or other protocols. This is managed by the DXIO and KPX hardware
 * blocks; however, those are not manipulated directly by us and instead those
 * are managed by different firmware images and hidden cores within the SoC. In
 * the SP3 generation this is often referred to as 'DXIO' firmware and in SP5,
 * 'MPIO'.
 *
 * We define our own types for declaring this I/O which the corresponding
 * platform code transforms into the appropriate type. We do this for a few
 * reasons:
 *
 *  1) Not all of the fields which the structures require are things that we
 *     need to set on a per-device basis.
 *  2) This allows us to refer to fields in a way that is more straightforward
 *     when looking at a schematic and then translate them as required into the
 *     underlying hardware settings. For example, SP3 needs to tell firmware
 *     lane numbers in a way that is rather different from the physical lane
 *     numbering. But what's easiest is to actually just refer to this using a
 *     group ala G2 and a lane offset in the group.
 *  3) Some fields reference information from an earlier part. For example,
 *     firmware ends up setting up traditional PCIe hotplug after it's set up
 *     the normal hotplug. The hotplug information sometimes wants information
 *     such as what bridge we trained something on.
 *  4) There are settings that we want to set on a physical slot that aren't
 *     specific to the underlying firmware and it's useful to have a uniform way
 *     of setting this up.
 *
 * The general idea here is that each board will define a series of
 * oxio_engine_t structures which represent all of the I/O that should be
 * configured in this way. That should be linked into the platform detection
 * logic so that it is always set and known on the board. That does imply a
 * static mapping of board to slot information, which is fine for the time
 * being, but may not be valid in the limit. That level of dynamicism is
 * deferred until needed.
 *
 * Finally, not everything that the underlying firmware supports is in here.
 * What we have is mostly what's used by Oxide products and the various
 * development boards that we are interested in using.
 *
 * Finally, some terminology. Some of this is adopted from AMD.
 *
 * ENGINE
 *
 *	An engine refers to a logical MAC/PHY combination. For example, an x4
 *	slot that may have an NVMe device (or really anything via a K.2) is
 *	considered a single engine.
 *
 * TILE
 *
 *	A tile refers to one of several instances of the PCIe IP. The 128 lanes
 *	are generally grouped into 8 groups of 16 lanes each. The tile names use
 *	the nomenclature from the AMD motherboard guide and pin outs.

/*
 * This file contains all of the different structures that are described by the
 * IPCC inventory subsystem and related. Similar to SMBIOS, different structures
 * have a type which is indicated by a tag and then is followed by a specific
 * structure that is based on that type. These structures have members that are
 * appended to them in subsequent software revisions and the length of the
 * overall data payload is used to indicate what is valid.
 *
 * Data availability history:
 *
 *  o The original version of data had all types through the KSZ. However, there
 *    were no sensors.
 *  o Sensors were added in release v1.0.2 of SP software. This added the
 *    MAX5970 type and initial versions of all sensors.
 *  o The MAX31790 was added in v1.0.13.

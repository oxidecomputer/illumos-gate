 * ipcc - interprocessor control channel
 *
 * The IPCC is a general communication channel between the Host and the
 * Service Processor (SP) supporting a unidirectional RPC interface in which
 * SP software provides the server and the Host acts as a client. The Host and
 * SP communicate using a dedicated async serial channel operating at 3,000,000
 * bits/s and employing hardware flow control. There are also a pair of
 * interrupt lines between the Host and SP which are used for out-of-band
 * signalling, although only the SP-to-Host interrupt is currently used in
 * this implementation.
 *
 * The SP is a device with constrained resources and in general when there is a
 * trade-off to be made, things are structured to make its life easier if
 * possible. The SP's firmware is written in the Rust programming language
 * which has a bearing on some of the choices made.
 *
 * Terminology
 * ===========
 *
 * Message:	Encoded data sent between the Host and the SP in either
 *		direction.
 *
 * Packet:	A message which has been framed for transmission over the
 *		channel. There is a 1:1 relationship between a message and
 *		a packet, with the packet being the COBS-encoded form of the
 *		message.
 *
 * hubpack:	A predictable serialisation algorithm, implemented for the Rust
 *		programming language in a crate -
 *		https://github.com/cbiffle/hubpack/
 *
 * COBS:	Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing. A framing technique which
 *		removes all occurences of a particular byte in data without
 *		significantly increasing the data size, allowing that byte
 *		to be used unambiguously as a terminator.
 *
 * Protocol
 * ========
 *
 * The protocol used over this channel is deliberately fairly simple. It has
 * the following key characteristics:
 *
 * 1. The host only ever initiates requests by sending data on the channel, and
 *    the SP only ever replies to requests.
 *
 * 2. Only one request may be outstanding at a time, there is no pipelining.
 *
 * 3. Messages are structured as a set of fixed length fields, followed by zero
 *    or more bytes of additional variable length data, followed by a checksum.
 *
 * 4. The fixed length field portion of a message is encoded in a format
 *    compatible with the hubpack. This allows the SP software to easily
 *    deserialise the data into a native struct and then access the following
 *    variable length data directly, without having to copy it.
 *
 * 5. Messages are transformed into packets suitable for sending over the
 *    channel using COBS, using a zero byte as the frame terminator.
 *
 * Provision for SP-initiated data transfer
 * ========================================
 *
 * Since the protocol requires that all requests are initiated by the host, an
 * additional mechanism is required if the SP has any reason to notify the host
 * of an event. This is achieved through the use of a GPIO line connected
 * between the SP and the Host. This line is used as a level-triggered
 * active-low interrupt. This line is usually high from the host's perspective,
 * but if the SP needs to notify the host that an event has occured or that
 * other data of interest is available, it will drive it low. The host can then
 * make requests to enumerate the set of pending events and then retrieve the
 * associated data or to clear the events.
 *
 * XXX - at present, the only event of interest here is an indication that the
 *	 SP task handling the protocol has (re)started which may require a
 *	 resynchronisation between the host and the SP. As such the host
 *	 currently only polls the interrupt while it is actively communicating
 *	 with the SP; re-synchronisation is covered below.
 *	 In the future, once the kernel GPIO framework gains support for
 *	 handling interrupts and there are other events of interest, the
 *	 interrupt should be serviced promptly regardless of whether
 *	 communication is active.
 *
 * Message encoding
 * ================
 *
 * Messages are structured as:
 *
 *    header | fixed length fields | optional variable length data | crc
 *
 * with the header being itself a sequence of fixed length fields:
 *
 *    magic(u32) | version(u32) | sequence(u64) | command(u8)
 *
 * encoded in a hubpack-compatible format. The fields that appear in all
 * messages are:
 *
 *	magic		A fixed magic number (IPCC_MAGIC).
 *	version		Protocol version number.
 *	sequence	A sequence number which increments for each Host->SP
 *			message. The SP uses the value from a request when
 *			responding, but also sets the top bit.
 *	command		Requested action (for requests) or a response code
 *			(for replies). This is a u8 because it is likely to be
 *			deserialised into an enum on the SP side, and hubpack
 *			represents enums as a u8.
 *	crc		A Fletcher-16 checksum calculated over the entire
 *			message up to the end of data'.
 *
 * Generally the SP deserialises the header and the fixed length fields
 * associated with a particular message, leaving any variable data in the
 * original buffer and accessing it there directly without having to copy it
 * around and use more memory.
 *
 * Framing and synchronisation
 * ===========================
 *
 * Using COBS to frame packets on the wire has a number of benefits. Either end
 * is able to unambiguously identify the end of a packet and either end can
 * terminate a partial packet sent by just writing a frame terminator. There
 * are, however, some situations that can cause the two ends of the channel get
 * out of sync and the protocol implementation has to be able to deal with
 * this.
 *
 * First, it is conceivable that corruption could occur during transmission.
 * This has not been seen in extensive testing on two separate servers (where
 * gigabytes of data have been transferred over this channel) but it's worth
 * thinking through what would happen if it did. Assuming the corruption is
 * within the body of the packet, then it may be detected by checksum at the
 * end of the frame; that checksum is using the Fletcher-16 algorithm which is
 * cheap for the SP to calculate. Assuming the checksum appears correct, then
 * the magic and version fields will be checked and, on the Host side, the
 * sequence number in the response packet will be checked against the expected
 * value.
 *
 * If corruption is detected by the SP, then it will reply with a special
 * message that indicates it is unable to decode the request, and the host will
 * re-send. Similarly, if the host detects corruption in a reply, it will
 * discard it and re-send the request.
 *
 * A special case is if there is corruption in the frame terminator itself.
 * Without anything being done to guard against this the channel would
 * become permanently wedged. Implementing a timeout here was considered but
 * discarded as an option because there is no guaranteed response time for any
 * message sent to the SP. Some messages are likely to take a while and the SP
 * is not a hard real-time OS, so selecting an appropriate timeout value is
 * difficult. The solution implemented here is for each side to follow up a
 * packet with periodic additional frame terminators, while waiting for a
 * reply, possibly filling up the Tx FIFO. When read by the other side of the
 * channel, this just appears as an empty packet and is discarded. The code
 * here sends one of these extra terminators around every 0.1 seconds while a
 * reply is outstanding (the period is not critical).
 *
 * Another way that synchronisation can be lost is if the SP task
 * panics/restarts after the host has sent a command. In that case it will come
 * back up without the command to process and the host will still be waiting.
 * To address this, the SP maintains a 64-bit status register and whenever it
 * is non-zero, it asserts the out-of-band interrupt. Whenever the SP task
 * starts or restarts, it sets a bit in that register to indicate that, which
 * has the side effect of asserting the interrupt. The host notices this
 * and gives up sending/waiting for the active command, and issues a new
 * request to retrieve the status register. It then processes the bits which
 * are set there, clearing them by retrieving data from the SP or send commands
 * to acknowledge the event. Once the register is clear (and the interrupt
 * de-asserted), the original command is sent again.
 *
 * Whilst this next part is implemented on the SP side, it's worth mentioning
 * what happens if the reverse occurs. One of the messages that the host can
 * send to the SP is a notification of a panic. If a panic occurs while
 * processing a different message, there is a situation where the SP can be
 * blocked writing a response to the host and the host is blocked writing the
 * panic message to the SP. This is handled in the SP by it continuing to read
 * from the host even while it is sending a response. Usually it just sees the
 * empty frames mentioned above, but if it sees a new command then it throws
 * away what it is trying to send and processes that.
 *
 * Finally, in testing we've seen a situation where the host and the SP are out
 * of step. The host is transmitting requests and the SP is returning replies,
 * but the SP reply is a response to an old request. In this case, when an SP
 * reply is valid in all aspects apart from having a bad sequence number, the
 * host will discard the reply and listen again, without re-sending.
 *
 * Sequence number
 * ==============
 *
 * Each message contains a 64-bit sequence number in the header which is used
 * to uniquely identify a particular request (wraparound aside). When a message
 * must be re-transmitted for any reason, those retransmissions will carry the
 * same sequence number as the original. In particular this allows the receiver
 * to detect a retransmitted message so that it can reply with the same data
 * rather than assuming that its last response was successfully received.
 * This is especially important for things such as alert messages where a
 * message would otherwise be lost. Note that sequence numbers may not always
 * be used in order. For example, if message X is delayed because the SP has
 * asserted its interrupt line, then additional messages X + 1 .. X + n will be
 * sent to process the cause of this, before message X is finally sent.
 *
 * Phases of boot
 * ==============
 *
 * The host needs to be able to send requests to the SP at various times. First
 * it must be able to retrieve information very early in boot in order to
 * configure boot properties and system debugging options (for example, whether
 * to load the kmdb debugger). It must also be able to communicate later in
 * boot, once the virtual memory subsystem is initialised but before the device
 * tree is available or the STREAMS subsystem is available, and lastly it must
 * be able to operate once the system is fully up and in multi-user mode, and
 * it must also provide an interface that authorised userland applications can
 * use in order to communicate with the SP.
 *
 * Early in boot when there is only 'unix' - no kernel modules have yet been
 * loaded - and the kernel virtual memory subsystem is not available, the UART
 * that provides the control channel must be driven directly by accessing
 * registers via MMIO. The virtual address backing for that MMIO region is
 * necessarily allocated from boot pages and similarly for the MMIO region used
 * for reading the GPIO to determine the interrupt status.
 *
 * These boot pages are torn down during boot, shortly after KVM is available.
 * In the small window while both are usable, new MMIO VA mappings are obtained
 * from the device arena.
 *
 * Once the system is up, the UART is accessed via an instance of the dwu
 * driver via its /devices node, and the GPIO is checked via a DPIO node under
 * /dev. These are both accessed via LDI.
 *
 * This file implements the core IPCC protocol and does not need to know these
 * details, it just requires that consumers provide an ops vector containing
 * routines to access the hardware. The required routines are described in more
 * detail below.
 *
 * However, the necessity to work across the different boot phases does impose
 * some requirements, and lend itself quite neatly to some things:
 *
 * The early boot phase requires that this code live in 'unix' and that it not
 * use any functions from modules such as 'genunix' until they are loaded. To
 * achieve this it assumes it is in a single-threaded world until
 * ipcc_begin_multithreaded() is called, and does not use mutex_enter/exit
 * until that time. It also uses bcopy() instead of memcpy() since there is a
 * stub version of that available, and avoids string functions which are not
 * guaranteed to be present, see ipcc_loghex() for an example of this.
 *
 * The protocol needs regions of memory for constructing messages and packets.
 * While callers could pass in buffers for this, allocated from whatever memory
 * is available to them depending on the boot phase, only one transaction can
 * be in progress at a time. Therefore this file defines two global static
 * buffers for this. To use the channel, a caller must use
 * ipcc_channel_acquire() to gain exclusive access, and call the corresponding
 * ipcc_channel_release() when finished, including being finished with any
 * pointers into these global buffers. There is more about this in the block
 * comment above the ipcc_command_locked() function.
 *
 * Ops Vector
 * ==========
 *
 * As mentioned already, the protocol implementation in this file needs to be
 * able to access the hardware - both the UART and the GPIO - in any of the
 * boot phases. In order to abstract that, the exposed APIs require that
 * callers pass in an ops vector that provides the following entry points.
 * There is also provision for an additional opaque parameter which is used as
 * the first argument when invoking a callback. The callbacks are shown below;
 * any which are mandatory are prefixed with a '+', others may be left as NULL
 * if not required and they will not be called.
 *
 *	 io_open	Open the channel.
 *	 io_close	Close the channel.
 *	 io_flush	As far as is possible, flush the buffers of the
 *			communications channel. This should as a minimum
 *			discard any data queued in any inbound or outbound
 *			buffer, although the SP may still have data to
 *			transmit and will do so once the CTS signal is
 *			re-asserted.
 *	+io_poll	Block until either:
 *			 1. The SP asserts its SP->Host interrupt signal;
 *			 2. One of the requested events occurs on the channel;
 *			 3. The (optional) provided timeout is exceeded.
 *			Return ETIMEDOUT (for 3), EINTR if interrupted,
 *			otherwise 0.
 *	+io_readintr	Return true/false depending on whether the SP is
 *			currently asserting the SP->Host out-of-band interrupt
 *			signal.
 *	+io_read	Read data from the channel.
 *	+io_write	Send data to the channel.
 *	 io_log		Receive a log message.
 *
 * If not NULL, the first of these to be called for a given transaction is
 * 'io_open', and the last is 'io_close'. The flow for an IPCC transaction
 * looks something like:
 *
 * -> entry point, ipcc_XXX(vector, arg, params...)
 *   -> ipcc_channel_acquire()
 *     -> io_open()
 *       -> io_readintr()
 *       -> io_poll(POLLOUT)
 *       -> io_write()
 *       -> io_poll(POLLIN)
 *       -> io_read()
 *     -> io_close()
 *   -> ipcc_channel_release()
 *
 * Retransmissions
 * ===============
 *
 * As may have become apparent from what's above, there are some cases when the
 * host will automatically resend a message during a transaction. This can
 * occur when:
 *
 *  - the SP asserts its interrupt while the host is sending or waiting for
 *    a response;
 *  - the SP replies to a request with 'Decode Failure';
 *  - the host has read IPCC_MAX_PACKET_SIZE bytes from the SP without finding
 *    a frame terminator;
 *  - the host cannot decode the COBS frame received from the SP;
 *  - the decoded packet from the SP is shorter than IPCC_MIN_PACKET_SIZE;
 *  - the reply message checksum does not match;
 *  - the magic number in the reply message is incorrect;
 *  - the version number in the reply message is incorrect;
 *  - a request sequence number was found in the reply.
 *
 * XXX - the implementation currently applies an arbitrary limit for the number
 *       of retransmissions that are attempted before giving up. This is the
 *       IPCC_MAX_ATTEMPTS macro below. Any loss of synchronisation on the
 *       channel should be resolved well before this limit is reached.
 *       XXX - panic instead?
 *
 * Consumers
 * =========
 *
 * There are currently two separate consumers of this protocol code in the
 * tree. One for the early stages of boot, and one for when the system is up
 * and multi-user. The first of these is kernel_ipcc which issues requests
 * to ipcc_proto and handles communicating with the underlying UART and GPIO on
 * its behalf.

 * The second consumer is the 'ipcc' kernel module which provides callbacks that

 * As touched on above, once the system is multi-user, the kernel can use two
 * different method to communicate with the service processor. The expected path
 * for most requests is to use the same method as userland - that is to open the
 * ipcc module device node and issue ioctl()s via LDI. However the more direct
 * route that is used in early boot is still used for issuing reboot, powerdown,
 * bootfail and panic messages in order to minimise what is necessary to support
 * these. In the case of reboot, for example, all CPUs but one should be stopped
 * and interrupts are no longer being delivered at the point that the call is
 * made.

/*
 * This is the main interface for sending a command to the SP via the IPCC.
 *
 * Callers must acquire exclusive access to the channel prior to calling this
 * function.
 *
 * The parameters are:
 *
 *	ops		- A set of callbacks to use, see above.
 *	arg		- An opaque argument to be passed to callback functions.
 *	cmd		- The command.
 *	expected_rcmd	- The expected response command.
 *	dataout		- A pointer to a sequence of bytes which is to be
 *			  included to the outgoing command. NULL if there is
 *			  no additional data to be sent.
 *	dataoutl	- The number of bytes pointed to by dataout.
 *	datain		- The address of a pointer which will be set to the
 *			  start of any data payload in the reply message from
 *			  from the SP. Can be NULL if no data is expected, in
 *			  which case the receipt of additional data is an error
 *			  and EINVAL will be returned.
 *	datainl		- A pointer to a variable where the length of the
 *			  received data will be stored. This variable may be
 *			  set to a value prior to calling in which case it is
 *			  an error if the length of the received data is
 *			  different. If the variable is zero on entry, no such
 *			  check is done; this supports replies with a variable
 *			  length payload.
 *
 * On return, 'datain' will be pointing to a global buffer and so consumers
 * must continue to hold the channel until they have finished processing the
 * returned data.
 *
 * This function can return:
 *
 *	0		- Success.
 *	EINTR		- The request was interrupted by a signal.
 *	ETIMEDOUT	- Despite a number of retries, communication was
 *			  unsuccessful. The caller should consider this a fatal
 *			  problem with the channel.
 *	ENOBUFS		- Out of buffer space; too much payload data was
 *			  provided.
 *	EINVAL		- Additional payload data was received and datain is
 *			  NULL.
 *	EIO		- The amount of data received does not match the input
 *			  value of datainl.
 *	E*		- Any error returned by the io_read and io_write
 *			  callbacks.
 *
 * ipcc_command() is a simpler wrapper around ipcc_command_locked() for the
 * case where no reply data is expected. It also takes care of acquiring and
 * releasing the channel.

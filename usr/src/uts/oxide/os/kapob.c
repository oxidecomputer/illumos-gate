/*
 * When an AMD SoC is initialized, a variety of parameters are sourced from the
 * boot flash by the AGESA Boot Loader (ABL) running on the PSP; AMD calls this
 * the APCB which has several possible expansions depending on the source you
 * prefer (we'll go with AGESA PSP Configuration Block).  After the ABL
 * processes all this, parts of it, along with data about the ABL's activities,
 * are transformed and output for us into RAM in the form of something called
 * the APOB (AGESA PSP Output Block). This file attempts to iterate, parse, and
 * provide a means of getting at it.  For the most part, the APOB's contents
 * aren't interesting; we can get the same information from the hardware, and
 * prefer that source.  There are a few possible exceptions related to memory
 * initialisation, however, so we keep the data around and provide these simple
 * mechanisms for interpreting it.
 *
 * The APOB is a TLV-ish type structure; we are given its total size but finding
 * data of interest requires walking it from the start.  We get an initial
 * header (apob_header_t) which is always immediately followed by the first
 * entry (hence why it is in the structure). Each entry itself contains its size
 * and has an absolute offset to the next entry.
 *
 * While we currently keep the APOB around forever, we don't intend that it be
 * accessed by kernel consumers once we've booted and attached any drivers that
 * might be interested in it (e.g., memory controller RAS).  Our intention is
 * that anything we really need from the APOB will end up in some other kernel
 * data structure such as the devinfo tree; however, mainly for diagnostic
 * purposes we do provide a generic access mechanism for user software.  The
 * APOB is considered read-only at all times; it makes no sense to modify it and
 * indeed it's important that consumers understand it may not reflect the actual
 * state of the machine, only what firmware wanted us to believe the state of
 * the machine was when we started running.
 *
 * As far as we know, the basic structure of the APOB itself has remained the
 * same for a long time, and what we have here is useful on a range of different
 * processors with different ABL versions.  While the APOB contains some
 * self-describing version information, observations indicate that this isn't
 * very reliable in terms of describing the format of the APOB's contents.  The
 * code here does not interpret the contents, only the basic structural
 * metadata, which appears fairly stable.  All we can do is hope that any major
 * format change will come with a non-overlapping set of version numbers.  In
 * addition, the interpretation of entries in the APOB is entirely specific to
 * the processor family and possibly also the firmware revision; consumers, both
 * kernel and userland, are responsible for selecting the proper interpretation
 * on whatever nebulous and unreliable basis they prefer. AMD considers the APOB
 * format to be a Private interface between parts of their firmware, and on PCs
 * it is not (intentionally) exposed to the OS at all.  In fact, it is kept in
 * "BIOS reserved" memory and can be accessed via the xsvc driver just like ACPI
 * tables, provided the user knows where it is.  We provide a much more
 * straightforward user access mechanism on this platform, since the APOB is
 * merely a chunk of ordinary kernel memory.

/*
 * This file deals with all the knowledge related to supported, standard NVMe
 * features as well as validation of other requests related to features. While
 * there are vendor-specific features, we currently don't support issuing them
 * to the kernel.
 *
 * Like other parts of the common NVMe logic, we have two different sets of data
 * tables to help us drive validation:
 *
 * 1) We have a list of fields that are supported in the kernel ioctl interface
 * and libnvme for features. There are some fields like allowing a specification
 * via UUID which are not currently supported. The field tables are split up
 * among get and set features because they are somewhat different in terms of
 * what they allow (i.e. set features may use cdw12, cdw13, cdw15, etc.) and
 * because the kernel doesn't support issuing set features from userland today.
 *
 * 2) We have a table of NVMe specified required and optional features. This
 * table has dynamic properties related to whether things are supported and the
 * set of fields that are usable because some aspects of this change with the
 * specification version (e.g. the temperature threshold feature had no input
 * argument in cdw11 in NVMe 1.0).

.SH NAME
bioinit \- initialize a buffer structure
.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <sys/sunddi.h>

\fBvoid\fR \fBbioinit\fR(\fBstruct buf *\fR\fIbp\fR);
.fi

.SH INTERFACE LEVEL

Pointer to the buffer header structure.
.RE

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbioinit()\fR function initializes a \fBbuf\fR(9S) structure. A buffer
structure contains state information which has to be initialized if the memory
for the buffer was allocated using \fBkmem_alloc\fR(9F). This is not necessary
for a buffer allocated using \fBgetrbuf\fR(9F) because \fBgetrbuf()\fR will
call \fBbioinit()\fR directly.
.SH CONTEXT
The \fBbioinit()\fR function can be called from any context.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fBExample 1 \fRUsing \fBbioinit()\fR
.sp
.in +2
.nf

struct buf *bp = kmem_alloc(biosize(), KM_SLEEP);
bioinit(bp);
/* use buffer */
.fi

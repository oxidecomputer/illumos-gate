.TH WCHAR.H 3HEAD "Aug 15, 2014"
.SH NAME
wchar.h, wchar \- wide-character handling
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <\fBwchar.h\fR>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The <\fBwchar.h\fR> header defines the following types:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwchar_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
As described in <\fBstddef.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwint_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
An integer type capable of storing any valid value of \fBwchar_t\fR or
\fBWEOF\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBwctype_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
A scalar type of a data object that can hold values which represent
locale-specific character classification.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBmbstate_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
An object type other than an array type that can hold the conversion state
information necessary to convert between sequences of (possibly multi-byte)
characters and wide characters.  If a codeset is being used such that  an
\fBmbstate_t\fR needs to preserve more than two levels of reserved state, the
results are unspecified.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBFILE\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
As described in <\fBstdio.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBsize_t\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
As described in <\fBstddef.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBva_list\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
As described in <\fBstdarg.h\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The implementation supports one or more programming environments in which the
width of \fBwint_t\fR is no greater than the width of type \fBlong\fR. The
names of these programming environments can be obtained using the
\fBconfstr\fR(3C) function or the \fBgetconf\fR(1) utility.
.sp
.LP
The <\fBwchar.h\fR> header defines the following macros:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWCHAR_MAX\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The maximum value representable by an object of type \fBwchar_t\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWCHAR_MIN\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
The minimum value representable by an object of type \fBwchar_t\fR.
.RE
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBWEOF\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
Constant expression of type \fBwint_t\fR that is returned by several WP
functions to indicate end-of-file.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBNULL\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 13n
As described in <\fBstddef.h\fR>.
.RE
.LP
The tag \fBtm\fR is declared as naming an incomplete structure type, the
contents of which are described in the header <\fBtime.h\fR>.
.LP
Inclusion of the <\fBwchar.h\fR> header can make visible all symbols from the
headers <\fBctype.h\fR>,  <\fBstring.h\fR>, <\fBstdarg.h\fR>, <\fBstddef.h\fR>,
<\fBstdio.h\fR>, <\fBstdlib.h\fR>, and <\fBtime.h\fR>.

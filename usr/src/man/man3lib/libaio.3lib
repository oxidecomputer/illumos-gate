.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
Historically, functions in this library provided asynchronous I/O operations.
This functionality now resides in \fBlibc\fR(3LIB)
.sp
.LP
This library is maintained to provide backward compatibility for both runtime
and compilation environments. The shared      object is implemented as a filter
on libc.so.1. New application development need not specify \fB-laio\fR.
.SH INTERFACES
.sp
.LP
The shared object \fBlibaio.so.1\fR provides the public interfaces defined
below. See \fBIntro\fR(3) for additional information on shared object
interfaces.

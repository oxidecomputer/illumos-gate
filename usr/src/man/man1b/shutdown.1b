.TH SHUTDOWN 1B "Oct 11, 1994"
.SH NAME
shutdown \- close down the system at a given time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ucb/shutdown\fR [\fB-fhknr\fR] \fItime\fR [\fIwarning-message\fR]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBshutdown\fR provides an automated procedure to notify users when the system
is to be shut down. \fBtime\fR specifies when \fBshutdown\fR will bring the
system down; it may be the word \fBnow\fR (indicating an immediate shutdown),
or it may specify a future time in one of two formats: \fB+\fR\fInumber\fR and
\fIhour\fR\fB:\fR\fImin.\fR The first form brings the system down in
\fInumber\fR minutes, and the second brings the system down at the time of day
indicated in 24-hour notation.
.sp
.LP
At intervals that get closer as the apocalypse approaches, warning messages are
displayed at terminals of all logged-in users, and of users who have remote
mounts on that machine.
.sp
.LP
At shutdown time a message is written to the system log daemon,
\fBsyslogd\fR(8), containing the time of shutdown, the instigator of the
shutdown, and the reason. Then a terminate signal is sent to \fBinit\fR, which
brings the system down to single-user mode.

.SH NAME
fcoet \- fibre channel over Ethernet target mode driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfcoet\fR driver is a pseudo device driver which encapsulates the raw
Fibre Channel frames into FCoE Ethernet frames, or decapsulates FC frames from
FCoE Ethernet frames. The supported FC frames contain extended/basic link
services, common transport frames and target mode FCP frames.
.sp
.LP
The \fBfcoet\fR driver interfaces with COMSTAR FC transport driver, \fBfct\fR,
and FCoE transport driver, \fBfcoe\fR(4D).

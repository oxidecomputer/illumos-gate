.Sh NAME
.Nm kgpio
.Nd Kernel GPIO and DPIO driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /dev/dpio/
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to general purpose and dedicated purpose I/Os
that are built using the kernel's GPIO framework.
See
.Xr gpio 7
for general background and an overview of the system's design.
GPIO controllers that are registered with the framework are made
available to the system through this driver.
In addition, when a DPIO is created, the
.Nm
driver is what is responsible for providing that abstraction.
.Pp
GPIO controllers, GPIO attributes, and the manipulation of DPIOs can be
explored through the
.Xr gpioadm 8
utility.
.Pp
In general, the specific programming interfaces and aspects of the
.Nm
driver are considered private to the system and
.Sy Volatile ,
subject to change without notice.

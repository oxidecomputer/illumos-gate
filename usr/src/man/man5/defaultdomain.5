.TH DEFAULTDOMAIN 5 "Feb 25, 2017"
.SH NAME
defaultdomain \- specify host's domain name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/etc/defaultdomain\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The file \fB/etc/defaultdomain\fR determines a host's domain name for direct
use by the \fBNIS\fR name service. The \fBdefaultdomain\fR file
is read at boot time and its contents used by the \fBdomainname\fR(8) command.
Because of its use by \fBdomainname\fR, \fBdefaultdomain\fR is also used by the
\fBLDAP\fR service (see \fBldap\fR(1)). Under certain, narrow circumstances
(see \fBresolv.conf\fR(5)), because \fBdomainname\fR uses \fBdefaultdomain\fR,
a \fBDNS\fR client can use the contents of \fBdefaultdomain\fR.
.sp
.LP
The contents of \fBdefaultdomain\fR consists of a single line containing a
host's domain name.
.SH SEE ALSO
.LP
.BR uname (1),
.BR resolv.conf (5),
.BR ldapclient (8),
.BR ypbind (8),
.BR ypinit (8)
.SH NOTES
.LP
The \fBdefaultdomain\fR file is created and modified by Solaris installation
and configuration scripts. Only users knowledgeable of name service
configuration should edit the file.

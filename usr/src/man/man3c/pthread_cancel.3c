.TH PTHREAD_CANCEL 3C "Nov 2, 2007"
.SH NAME
pthread_cancel \- cancel execution of a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
cc -mt [ \fIflag\fR... ] \fIfile\fR... -lpthread [ \fIlibrary\fR... ]
#include <pthread.h>

\fBint\fR \fBpthread_cancel\fR(\fBpthread_t\fR \fItarget_thread\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBpthread_cancel()\fR function requests that \fItarget_thread\fR be
canceled.
.sp
.LP
By default, cancellation is deferred until \fItarget_thread\fR reaches a
cancellation point. See \fBcancellation\fR(7).
.sp
.LP
Cancellation cleanup handlers for \fItarget_thread\fR are called when the
cancellation is acted on. Upon return of the last cancellation cleanup handler,
the thread-specific data destructor functions are called for
\fItarget_thread\fR. \fItarget_thread\fR is terminated when the last destructor
function returns.
.sp
.LP
A thread acting on a cancellation request runs with all signals blocked. All
thread termination functions, including cancellation cleanup handlers and
thread-specific data destructor functions, are called with all signals blocked.
.sp
.LP
The cancellation processing in  \fItarget_thread\fR runs asynchronously with
respect to the calling thread returning from \fBpthread_cancel()\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
.LP
If successful, the \fBpthread_cancel()\fR function returns  \fB0\fR. Otherwise,
an error number is returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
.LP
The  \fBpthread_cancel()\fR function may fail if:
.sp
.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBESRCH\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
No thread was found with an \fBID\fR corresponding to that specified by the
given thread \fBID,\fR \fItarget_thread\fR.

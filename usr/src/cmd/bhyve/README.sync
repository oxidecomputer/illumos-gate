The bhyve userland code in this directory, and its associated libraries and
parts of the kernel module have been updated to the latest upstream FreeBSD
sources as of:

    commit 3ebe1109348f53f64b395293578416abedef4090
    Author: Robert Wing <rew@FreeBSD.org>

        bhyve: sweep MAX_VMNAME

        MAX_VMNAME is no longer used.

Divergence Notes:

The kernel component of bhyve has diverged from the FreeBSD sources and
will continue to evolve away from the initial compatibility interfaces towards
native illumos ones. The vmmapi library abstracts those interfaces wherever
possible so that the bhyve userspace can remain close to upstream.

The source code for the following components is present and included in
syncs from FreeBSD, but currently disabled. See the comments in 'Makefile'
for more details:

	kernemu_dev
	virtio-scsi
	audio backend
	virtio_input

The draft Save/Restore functionality, added in FreeBSD commit
483d953a86a2507355f8287c5107dc827a0ff516, has not been synced into illumos bhyve
yet.  It is not built by default in FreeBSD, so we're not interested in taking
it until it successfully endures more in-depth testing.

The stub usr/src/compat/bhyve/stdatomic.h file only includes enough glue
to satisfy the use of <stdatomic.h> in usr/src/cmd/bhyve/rfb.c, and in
particular assumes that atomic variables are sized as an int. If other bhyve
pieces start using stdatomic.h, this will need enhancing.
